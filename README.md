# Cellular Automata

This is a sample project to show the behaviour of unidimensional cellular automata. 

You need to install Maven to compile this project.  

Once you have installed Maven, you can create a fatjar with `mvn clean package` that will generate two jar's files. The 
one called `cellular-automata-jar-with-dependencies.jar` will include all dependencies for the project, so you can just run 
it with `java -jar cellular-automata-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.
